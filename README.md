# Indian Music Consumption Trends on Spotify

## 📌 Project Overview
India’s music ecosystem is linguistically and culturally diverse, with Spotify hosting content across multiple Indian languages and musical styles. While some songs achieve widespread popularity, others with similar characteristics fail to gain traction, making music success difficult to predict.

This project presents a **data-driven analytical dashboard built using Power BI** to understand language-wise music consumption patterns in India, identify the key factors influencing song popularity, and forecast future trends to support better business decision-making for Spotify India.

---

## 🎯 Business Problem
Spotify India wants to:
- Understand how music preferences vary across Indian languages  
- Track how popularity trends evolve over time  
- Identify what makes a song successful (hit vs non-hit)  
- Predict future popularity trends to improve regional marketing and playlist curation  

However, without a consolidated analytical view, these insights remain difficult to derive from raw streaming data.

---

## 🎯 Objective
The objective of this project is to build a **single-page interactive Power BI dashboard** that:

- Analyzes language-wise song distribution  
- Tracks historical popularity trends  
- Forecasts future popularity for the next 2–3 years  
- Compares audio features with song popularity  
- Classifies songs into hit and non-hit categories  
- Provides interpretable insights to support data-driven decisions  

---

## 📂 Dataset
The analysis is based on the **Spotify Indian Languages Dataset** sourced from Kaggle.

- Individual language-wise CSV files were merged into a single unified dataset  
- A new `Language` column was derived from file names  
- Final dataset: `Merged_Indian_Spotify_Dataset`
